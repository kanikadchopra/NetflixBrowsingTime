# NetflixBrowsingTime
Conducted an experiment for STAT430 to determine the optimal combination of preview length, match score and tile size to minimize average browsing time spent on the Netflix homepage.

### Files
1. `Project_Code.Rmd`: All of the code lives in a R Markdown file. This was used to conduct the exploratory analysis and factor screening to determine significant factors. This process also involved implementing the method of steepest descent and response optimization to locate the optimum for significant factor(s). 
2. `Data`: This folder contains the various stages of data collection. These correspond with the data used in `Project_Code.Rmd` and were collected through a data generation website Dr. Nathaniel Stevens had set up.
3. `Final Report.pdf`: This is the final report summarizing the results of this project.
